I plan on coding a memory game, with numbers flashing on the screen and buttons on the breadboard that correspond to those buttons on the breadboard, once the correct sequence is followed, the green led turns on.

For the Final I plan on using P5Js and Arduino as the libraries. This project would connect the idea of having several buttons and visuals on the screen and making a sort of sequence everytime the numbers are displayed on the screen with the corresponding button on the breadboard. My aim is to create an interactive way to incorporate all the things we have learnt in coding so far.

IDEA 1- 
The basic idea for my final is to create a classic snakes game using p5play and p5js, and introducing the arduino as a physical component by having an LED light up each time the snake touched it self and reloads the page. And the other LED lights up everytime it eats the randomised food source on the screen.

IDEA 2-
Animal crossing kind of game, with three LEDs on the breadboard indicating the traffic light. These will be time based, when the green turns on, only then should the component move on the screen, The element on the screen would be controlled by keyboard clicks. 

IDEA 3- 
Memory game- With 4-5 numbers flashing on the screen which would indicate the pattern/sequence of buttons to be pressed on the arduino. If the sequence is followed, green LED turns on, if a wrong button is pressed, a red LED turns on and the game restarts.

IDEA 4- 
Interactive maze- with LEDs on the arduino turning on everytime, a wrong turn is made/ hits a wall.
