IDEA 1- 
The basic idea for my final is to create a classic snakes game using p5play and p5js, and introducing the arduino as a physical component by having an LED light up each time the snake touched it self and reloads the page. And the other LED lights up everytime it eats the randomised food source on the screen.

IDEA 2-
Animal crossing kind of game, with three LEDs on the breadboard indicating the traffic light. These will be time based, when the green turns on, only then should the component move on the screen, The element on the screen would be controlled by keyboard clicks. 

IDEA 3- 
Memory game- With 4-5 numbers flashing on the screen which would indicate the pattern/sequence of buttons to be pressed on the arduino. If the sequence is followed, green LED turns on, if a wrong button is pressed, a red LED turns on and the game restarts.
